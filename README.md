# Technologies used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Greensock, PokéAPI.

# Description
This application allows a user to get information on a Pokémon by entering the name and submitting the form.  If a Pokémon isn't found, an error will display above the input asking the user to try again.  Pokémon data is retrieved from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) using the ".fetch()" JavaScript method.  The Pokémon sprites and information are dynamically created and rendered on the page using JavaScript.  Flavor text is randomized, so each time a user inquires about a Pokémon, a different description will show each time.  The colors on the application reflect the Pokémon's type(s) and change color depending on the type(s).  When a user clicks on the sprites, the Pokémon will do a little hop and its cry will play.  The hopping animation and color entrance animations were achieved using the [Greensock Animation Library](https://gsap.com/).
